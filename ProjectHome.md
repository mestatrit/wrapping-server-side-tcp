This is a java implementation of Lorenzo Alvisi, Thomas C. Bressoud, Ayman El-Khashab, Keith Marzullo and Dmitrii Zagorodnov's paper on Wrapping Server-side TCP to mask connection failures. We are creating this as a part of our third year Design Of Dependable Systems, Computer Science module.

The implementation will simulate the client, server and logger scenario.

The paper can be found here:

This implementation was created by James Bossingham, Sam Corcoran, Robert Holland, William Isseyegh, David Lewis and James Walker.
